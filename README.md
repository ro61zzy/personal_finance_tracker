**Welcome to My Spendy Tracker**

Vercel link : https://personalfinancetracker-apyrowcwp-rozzys-projects.vercel.app/

Allows a user to track their incomes and expenses

**Steps to Follow**

Once on the web app, supply the accounts with amounts, we have three different accounts that hold income;
you will see the total amount of all the accounts on the first card, **Current Remaining Amount**

The Pie chart helps you track your expenses, I had indicated the types of expenses that we have but time is running out and this component ain't working to my like

you can record your expenses and indicate from which account you are costing these expenses, I will add a drop-down to show the kind of expense you are recording

I was to set the initial amounts to zero so that a user can tell how the accounts are behaving, I, however, decided to work with figures from (useFinance) so as to tell if the App is working

**As of project submission**: The website is up but doesn't work as desiredüò≠

I will create a new branch that I will work on **after** to ensure the project works perfectly; I definitely would have wanted more time üï∞Ô∏è
