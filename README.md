Welcome to My Spendy Tracker

vercel link  

Allows a user to track their incomes and expenses

Steps to Follow

Once on the web app, supply the accounts with amounts, we have three different accounts that hold income;
you will see the total amount of all the accounts on the first card, Current Remaining Amount


the Pie chart helps you track your expenses, I had indicated the types of expenses that we have but time is running out and this component ain't working to my like

you can record your expenses and indicate from which account you are costing these expenses

I was to set the initial amounts to zero so that when user can tell how the accounts are behaving, I however decided to work with figures (useFinance) so as to tell if the App is working

As of project submission: web site is up but doesn't work as desired

I will create a new branch that I will work on after to ensure project works perfectly; definitely would have wanted more time
